# Command Line Lightweight Utility

A simple shell for Linux and Plan 9 written on C.

## Motivation

* I need a shell easy to modify, to make it work with (and without) a special system API on Linux.
* As that API is related with Plan 9, it would be convenient work there too with the same shell.
* "Luckily" the shell in that system (_rc_) lacks of some features, making work on Plan 9 a little more frustrating than needed.
* I need this working as soon as possible (_I'm late! I'm late!_).

## Description

So to overcome this problematic and reuse the solution as much I can with the same effort, I decided wrote a **simple** and **decoupled** program...

* ... which can be adapted to other spartan systems quickly.
* ... where most features can be modified (or disabled for compilation) easily.
