# Non-functional requirements

1. Easy to port! (The program pretends to be used in two different
systems, one of them in two distinct versions).

2. Easy to modify! (To work even with other system libraries).

3. Extremely decoupled! (See 1 and 2, also consider most features
can be expendables and able to work in the absence of the others).

4. It isn't desirable too many features...

5. But those it have must be as reusables as possible.

6. Readable source code.

7. Well documented.
