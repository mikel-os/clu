# Version naming

Version numbers follow [Uniform Version Numbering](version_naming/uniform_version_numbering.md).

Apart from that, every version of the program belong to a _codename family_. Every family gives a codename to the its versions of the program. Usually two-word names are used.

The codename can be used in header guards as project name. After be changed in future versions, the codename in the macros is changed only when the file is changed, otherwise remains as it is.

First codename family use a mocking or sarcastic name, maybe some "negative". That shows the uncertain and experimental state of the first versions. Out of there a more positive name will be picked.
